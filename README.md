# SQL Notes | Masterschool Exercises

## About This Repo

This is my personal SQL learning journal from the Masterschool Data Analytics program. It includes hands-on exercises, challenges, and practice notebooks organized by sprint. Each notebook reflects a different stage in my learning journeyâ€”from basic queries to advanced data manipulation.

## Basic & Intermediate SQL

### Sprint 1: SQL Fundamentals

Learn the basics of SQL, including query structure and filtering data. Understand how to apply conditions and multiple filters to refine queries.

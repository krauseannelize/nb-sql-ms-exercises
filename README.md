# SQL Notes | Masterschool Exercises

## About This Repo

This is my personal SQL learning journal from the Masterschool Data Analytics program. It includes hands-on exercises, challenges, and practice notebooks organized by sprint. Each notebook reflects a different stage in my learning journeyâ€”from basic queries to advanced data manipulation.

## Basic & Intermediate SQL

### Sprint 1: SQL Fundamentals

Learn the basics of SQL, including query structure and filtering data. Understand how to apply conditions and multiple filters to refine queries.

### Sprint 4: Unicorn Project & Practice Exercises

Sprint 4 centers around the Unicorn Project, a multi-part case study that integrates SQL, spreadsheets, and Tableau to simulate real-world data analytics work. The full Unicorn Project is documented in a separate repository: [Unicorn Performance Analysis](https://github.com/krauseannelize/da-ms-unicorn-performance).

This sprint also includes targeted practice notebooks focused on core SQL concepts.
